Instructions:

Create a React application composed of 5 components (Main, Adder, Imgr, Multiplier, Randomizer).

Each of the components should respond differently in response to the button clicks taking place from the Main parent.

One of the components 
1. adds the click counts, 
2. another multiplies, 
3. another provides a random number, 
4. and a final one chooses a random image from an array of images.
