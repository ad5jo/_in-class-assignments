Instructions:

Modify the skeleton code to take in a hard-coded DOB and then use MomentJS to render the age of that person.

Display that DOB and age in the browser using JSX.

Hint: You will need to npm install MomentJS and utilize it inside of your app.js file.

Note: Yep. We know you are rusty on MomentJS.
