    var randomDate = "02/23/1999";
// Instructions:

//Complete each of the activities listed in the comments.
//Note: You don't need to go in order.
//Note: Don't let the simple example fool you.
//Working with a new library can be tough. Be prepared to get frustrated. Stick with it!

    // Using scripts from moment.js write code below to complete each of the following.
    // Console.log to confirm the code changes we made worked.
    
    // 1 ...to convert the randomDate into three other date formats
    // 2 ...to determine the time in years, months, days between today and the randomDate
    // 3 ...to determine the number of days between the randomDate and 02/14/2001
    // 4 ...to convert the randomDate to unix time (be sure to look up what unix time even is!!!)
    // 5 ...to determine what day of the week and what week of the year this randomDate falls on.


//1. 

    // If you finish early...
    // Start creating HTML inputs and then redisplay the dates using moment.js elsewhere on the page.
