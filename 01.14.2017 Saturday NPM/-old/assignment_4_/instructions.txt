Instructions

Using the code sent to you earlier as a reference and using the code provided to you as a starter, create a Node application which takes in a movie name as a command line argument then uses the OMDB API to retrieve and return the release date to the console.

For this activity you have two options:

Easier: Require that the user provide a movie with a single word in the title (ex: Cinderella)

Harder: Allow the user to provide a movie with as many words as possible (ex: Forrest Gump).

Hint: Start by figuring out what your API URL should be then use the starter code as a guide.

Hint: Remember to npm install request or else your code will not work no matter what
