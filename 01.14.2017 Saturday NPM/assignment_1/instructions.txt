Instructions:

Starting from a blank file, create a Node-based command-line application that takes in a series of numbers from the user and returns the numbers sorted in ascending order.

Note: Feel free to use Stack Overflow or Google to find the code for sorting integers numerically.

Use .slice(x) to get a chunk of an array

var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"];
var citrus = fruits.slice(1, 3);
The result of citrus will be:

Orange,Lemon

map is run this on each element and creat a new array 

var numbers = (process.argv).slice(2);

function sorting(a,b) {
    return a - b;
}

var solution = numbers.map(parseFloat).sort(sorting);
console.log(solution);`
