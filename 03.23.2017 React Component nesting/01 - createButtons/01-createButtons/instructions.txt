Instructions:

Take a few moments to discuss the code provided to your partner. Make sure that each of you understand the syntax for:

1. Creating a state associated with a component.

2. Referencing the value of that state in the component itself.

3. Passing that state value to a child.

4. Accessing that parent's state value in the child as a prop.

Be prepared to share with the class.

Instructions:

With partners, create a simple React application composed of a parent and three child components.

1. Inside of the parent event you will create code that handles a button click. Whenever the button click is clicked, a counter will increase by one. This counter will constantly communicate the new count to the children components.

2. The children components will then utilize the click counter and each perform a different mathematical operation with the counter.

Note: You will need to do some research to solve this. Look into answering the following questions:

3. How can I handle a button click event in React? (Hint: onClick)

4. How can I change the state of a component in React? (Hint: setState)

Note: This may be challenging! We haven't covered everything just yet. Push yourself to consult Stack Overflow and React Documentation.
